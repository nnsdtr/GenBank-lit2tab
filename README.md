# DNA Barcoding in Fungi: GenBank-lit2tab

Biomarker sequences were downloaded from NCBI database in GenBank multi-record format and, after that, python script was built to extract specifically their literature data, saving it in a tabular form.

## Example call
`GenBank-lit2tab.py /home/user/GenBank-multirecord.gb`

## Python version

Python, version 3.5.2-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu). Copyright Â© 2001-2017 Python Software Foundation.

## Built With
